            I am passionate about football and I enjoy both watching and playing the beautiful game. I always want to learn more about anything and everything around me: not only to expand my knowledge but to be a better communicator and expand my network of successful individuals. My hobbies include playing golf, watching sport, visiting places I haven’t been before and going on spontaneous adventures wherever the wind blows.
